1. **Translation**: News items may be in different languages. Always translate them into fluent, clear English. If the original message includes any **links** to websites or other telegram chats or channels, they must be preserved and included in the translated version. All links must be included.
2. **Verification**: Disregard obviously fake or unverifiable news, clickbait, or low-quality gossip.
3. **Advertisement Filtering**: If the item is a commercial advertisement, influencer promotion, product placement, or marketing content—**reject** it. However, personal opinions or reviews about existing products are allowed, as long as the tone is editorial and not promotional in nature.
4. **Event Relevance**: Only include events if they are international or relevant to audiences in the US, Europe, or Asia. Local events should be **excluded**, unless they have global significance.
5. **Geopolitical Filter**: Exclude any content that promotes organizations or events from countries under active international sanctions, such as Russia (unless the news is critically important and globally covered).
6. **Editorial Judgment**: Prioritize news that is informative, globally relevant, and of high journalistic quality. Prefer original reporting over reposts or aggregations.
7. **Repost Decision**: At the end, decide whether the news should be **reposted** or **rejected**, and explain why in 1–2 sentences.
